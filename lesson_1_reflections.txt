How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It reduced the number of lines that had to be examined.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
When things go wrong you can revert to an earlier working version easily, and asses which change caused the problem.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros - not too many commits; commits can be at times when the state of the object is suitable
Cons - have to remember to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is aimed at software, where Google docs are general purpose files, and multi file documents may be uncommon.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log enables you to see why changes were made. Pasting the relevant ideas into diff shows the actual changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because it is easy to revert to the working version using checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Developing a Basic4android app
