What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git adds a hidden directory called .git. Git needs somewhere to store its meta data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temporary list of files. It allows changes to be made easily.
