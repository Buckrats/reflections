When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you work at more than one machine, when you want to collaborate, when you want an off site backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be limits on the bandwidth between the two, you may not want to incorporate changes made by somebody else without reviewing them.
